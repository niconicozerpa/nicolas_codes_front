                    <p><strong>Almost 2 milion people visit Infobae.com very day</strong>. This heavily visited
                    website is one of the most important news sites in Argentina and Latin America.</p>
                    <p>When I worked at the VI-DA Agency from Buenos Aires, I was responsible, together with my 
                    coworker Julia, <strong>for redesigning the site and building an integral system</strong>
                    to manage its contents.</p>
                    <p>This system not only had to deal with millions of daily visits, but it also must allow
                    the journalists to update the articles and media <strong>as quickly as possible</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Although it was the most stressful job I ever had, it has also been the most rewarding project as well.</p>

                    <p><strong>When e-commerce is more than e-commerce</strong>. Created in 2012, Halsbrook is
                    an online shop that offers luxury clothing and accessories from top American an European designers.
                    I've worked in this project through the VN Studios agency from Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p>
                    <p>But the underlying system behind Halsbrook does much more than just selling clothes. It manages
                    <strong>the entire lifecycle of the products</strong>, from the initial purchase from the vendors
                    until it reaches the final custoner.</p>
                    <p>Working like an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), the Halsbrook site also manages the inventory,
                    file taxes, handle product shipping, and generates multiple reports for accounting, inventory and
                    planning purposes.</p>
